    <h2>SkyPeggle: A Game with its own Engine</h2>
    Solo developer for SkyPeggle, a game developed using Swift for iPad. The project was created as part of a university course project for CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Platform at NUS.<br>
    The project demo can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O69BMAY5rIX0vHvJYiK-KcyPy9Ux6z6U/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> <br>
    This iOS Peggle‑style game mixes a custom physics engine, UIKit views, and level designer tooling; the app routes through a Menu that lets you choose levels, select a master
    (BB‑8 vs R2‑D2), and launches the GameViewController with that context.<br>
    <h3>Tech Stack & Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Swift + UIKit: refactored level designer into state+renderer helpers, persistent JSON levels, clean dependency injection</li>
      <li>Game logic: bespoke PhysicsEngine with circle‑OBB collision, chain reactions, physics callbacks (kaboom animation).</li>
    </ul>
