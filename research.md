### [Adversarial Robustness in One-stage Learning-to-Defer](https://github.com/yannismontreuil/adversarial_one_stage) (not published yet)
Extend the robustness framework of [Montreuil et al. (2025a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15729) to one-stage scenario, where considering the interaction between learning the predictor and adapting the experts.

### [Road Sign Classification with Denoising Pipeline Approach](https://github.com/FisherSkyi/classify_denoise_SwinIR). 

Real-world images are affected by image noise, which degrades the quality and reduces reliability of traffic sign recognition. This research proposes a denoiser-classifier pipeline approach, which uses a pre-trained color image denoiser, and compares it against an end-to-end approach. We evaluated CNN and ResNet-18 on GTSRB under Gaussian noise.
